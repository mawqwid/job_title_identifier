"From the September after a student has graduated, or if they are a current postgraduate student of Falmouth University, they can talk to us about signing on as an Associate.

"When thinking about a career, an ""elevator and escalator company"" is not usually high on anyone's list -- but it should be. These machines are taken for granted, but think of a world without them. No elevators would mean no tall buildings, which means no large compact cities, which would mean exponentially more urban sprawl and more traffic with longer commutes. That is a lot of wasted energy and is exactly what the world does",0.0
